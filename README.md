# WhisperGUI
A Graphical User Interface for transcribing audio files using OpenAI's Whisper Library.  It also allows the user to convert MP4 files into MP3 format as well.

# Prerequisites
To use the WhisperGUI, you need to have the following installed:
- a compatible version of Python - Whisper should be compatible with versions 3.9-3.11, however for sanity's sake, version 3.10.x should work fine and can be installed here: https://www.python.org/downloads/release/python-31012/
- Whisper - this can be pip along with its dependencies from the command line (after Python is installed) using:
  
     pip install git+https://github.com/openai/whisper.git 

- FFMPEG - this can be installed from here: https://ffmpeg.org/download.html
